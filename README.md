# TemperatureDatabase

As more and more industries are becoming data driven, being able to process a large volume of raw data and produce a concise and insightful summary is becoming more and more important. As a data consultant for a political candidate, you are tasked with processing some global temperature data and producing a report summarising some of the information.
The raw data is provided in 3 excel spreadsheets: (A) temperature by state, (B) temperature by country, (c) temperature by major city. You will need to complete the below tasks and present your results in a report.
For each python script, you should handle the case where the script has already been run and therefore the data already exists. This could mean checking to see if the table already existed in the database, or a specific workbook/worksheet already exists. In each case, you should decide what to do (display error ? Create a book/sheet with a different name ? Delete the existing version and run the script ?).
You should write a readme.txt file to accompany your scripts. Prepare a brief usage guide, any requirements and assumptions, and document what each script does and any other important info (for example; how does each script deal with database tables/excel sheets already existing).
